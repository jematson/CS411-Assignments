# Assignment Description

In this exercise, you will write a package that finds an optimal solution to a problem via exhaustive search.


A river flows from north to south. There are cities on the west bank and cities on the east bank. We wish to build bridges across the river. Each bridge will join a west-bank city with an east-bank city. We wish to choose the bridges we build in such a way as to maximize the tolls we collect from people crossing them.

There are two restrictions on the bridges we build. First, no city can have more than one bridge reaching it. Second, no two bridges can cross each other.

Concerning the second condition: the cities on each bank are numbered. There are w cities on the west bank, numbered 0, 1, … , w−1 (starting at zero, because we are computer programmers). And there are e cities on the east bank, numbered 0, 1, … , w−1. Suppose one bridge joins city a on the west to city b on the east. Another bridge joins city c on the west to city d on the east. If a < c and b > d, then these two bridges cross each other, and we are not allowed to build both.

For each pair of cities we might build a bridge between, we know the toll we will collect from it. Building a bridge never affects the toll collected from another bridge.
