# Assignment Description

Write a package that finds an optimal solution to the problem below via exhaustive search. 

A river flows from north to south. There are cities on the west bank and cities on the east bank. We wish to build bridges across the river. Each bridge will join a west-bank city with an east-bank city. We wish to choose the bridges we build in such a way as to maximize the tolls we collect from people crossing them.

There are two restrictions on the bridges we build. First, no city can have more than one bridge reaching it. Second, no two bridges can cross each other.

Return the greatest toll that can be collected from a legal set of bridges.
