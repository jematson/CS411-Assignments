# Assignment Description

## Part A: Greatest Contiguous Sum

Implement a simple Divide and Conquer algorithm to find the greatest contiguous sum of a sequence of numbers.

Given a sequence of numbers, the greatest contiguous sum (GCS) is the greatest sum that can be made by adding up some contiguous subsequence of the numbers.

## Part B: Counting Inversions

Modify an existing Divide and Conquer algorithm (Merge Sort) to count the number of inversions in a given sequence.

An inversion in a sequence of numbers is a pair of numbers that are in descending order.
